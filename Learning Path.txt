NETWORKING:

FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS: MTU, MSS, PATH MTU, ALL HEADERS (IP, ARP, DHCP, HTTP), 

TCP/IP SUITE:  ARP, TYPES OF ARP, ICPM- (PING/TRACEROUTE), DNS, DHCP, SMTP, FTP 

ROUTING: OSPF, BGP,  EIGRP

SWITCHING: 

NAT: SNAT, DNAT, LOOPBACK NAT, REFLEXIVE NAT

VPN: IPSEC (PHASE1,2), IPSEC TUNNEL MODES, SSL HANDHAKE

HTTP Header
| Verb | Path | HTTP version |
		Domain
		Accept
		Accept-language
		Accept-charset
		Accept-encoding(compression type)
		Connection- close or keep-alive
		Referrer
		Return address
		Expected Size?
		
HTTP Response Header: [HTTP version, Status Codes: (1xx: Informational Response, 2xx: Successful, 3xx: Redirection, 4xx: Client Error, 5xx: Server Error), 
Type of data in response, Type of encoding, Language, Charset]

TOOLS:
LINUX: dns testing, common network config files, network bonding modes, configuring network bonded interfaces, knowledge of linux firewall (netfilter, 
iptables (chains, rules, tables), manipulating firewalls on system, handling privileged ports and standard services, protecting system with ipset and
fail2ban 

NMAP:
advanced scanning, aggressive scanning, host discovery, OS & version scanning, TCP connect & stealth (SYN) scanning, UDP scanning, output & verbosity,
inverse TCP flag scanning, firewall detection (ACK probing), firewall evasion, scan timing & performance, Nmap scanning engine, NSE syntax, banner grabbing,
FTP DNS SMTP HTTP SMB MySQL Enumeration, vulnerability scanning

SECURITY:

IPS POLICIES: LAN TO WAN- (BROWSING, OS & services, malware communication, reconnaisance), WAN TO LAN ( OS & services, WEB, FTP, Mail, database, DNS and reconnaisance)

DOS PROTECTION BY SYN FLOOD,UDP FLOOD,TCP FLOOD,ICMP FLOOD

SPOOF PROTOECTION BY IP SPOOF, MAC SPOOF AND IP-MAC FILTERING

WEB AND APPLICATION protection BY WEB PROXY, HTTPS (SSL) DECRYPTION & INSPECTION, WEB FILTERING BASED ON DOMAINS

WEB SERVER PROTECTION: SlowHTTP protection, Cookie signing, Form hardening, static URL hardening, blocking clients with bad reputation, 
common threat blocing, antivirus

AUTHENTICATION: Understanding of Token-based, SSO, Session-based, OAuth (Open Authentication), JSON Web tokens based Authentication mechanism 
mechanism need to be addded

MALWARE & REVERSING: 
Interesting malware: Conficker, Morris worm. Zeus malware. Stuxnet. Wannacry. CookieMiner. Sunburst. 

Malware features:

Various methods of getting remote code execution. Domain-flux. Fast-Flux. Covert C2 channels. Evasion techniques (e.g. anti-sandbox). Process hollowing.
Mutexes. Multi-vector and polymorphic attacks. RAT (remote access trojan) features. 

Decompiling/ reversing: 

Obfuscation of code, unique strings (you can use for identifying code). IdaPro, Ghidra.

Static / dynamic analysis:

Describe the differences. Virus total. Reverse.it. Hybrid Analysis.

EXPLOITS:

Three ways to attack - Social, Physical, Network

Social:

Ask the person for access, phishing.
Cognitive biases - look at how these are exploited.
Spear phishing.
Water holing.
Baiting (dropping CDs or USB drivers and hoping people use them).
Tailgating.

Physical:

Get hard drive access, will it be encrypted?
Boot from linux.
Brute force password.
Keyloggers.
Frequency jamming (bluetooth/wifi).
Covert listening devices.
Hidden cameras.
Disk encryption.
Trusted Platform Module.
Spying via unintentional radio or electrical signals, sounds, and vibrations (TEMPEST - NSA).

Network:
Nmap.
Find CVEs for any services running.
Interception attacks.
Getting unsecured info over the network.

Remote Control:

Remote code execution (RCE) and privilege. Bind shell (opens port and waits for attacker). Reverse shell (connects to port on attackers C2 server).

Spoofing

Email spoofing. IP address spoofing. MAC spoofing. Biometric spoofing. ARP spoofing.
